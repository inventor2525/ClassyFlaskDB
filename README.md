# ClassyFlaskDB

ClassyFlaskDB is a Python library that allows you to use attributes on classes, fields, and properties to more easily save data to both a SQLite database as well as transmit it using Flask and receive it using Flask in both a remote version of the class and client version of the class so that it transparently looks like the client is simply accessing a local class.
