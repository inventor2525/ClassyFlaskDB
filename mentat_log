There was an error with your universal ctags installation, disabling CodeMap.
Reason: ctags --version does not claim to be universal ctags

You set ALLOW_32K to true, but your OpenAI API key doesn't have access to gpt-4-32k-0314. To remove this warning, set ALLOW_32K to false until you have access.

What can I do for you?
>>> Okay, I want to make a new Python library. So create me the standard file structure for the pip install, the setup.py, the readme, any license. For the l
icense file, use MIT. The package will be called ClassyFlaskDB, all one word. Its purpose will be to use attributes on classes, fields and properties to more
 easily save data to both a SQLite database as well as transmit it using Flask and receive it using Flask in both a remote version of the class and client ve
rsion of the class so that it transparently looks like the client is simply accessing a local class.                                                         

Including CodeMap (filepaths only)

I will create the standard file structure for the pip install, including setup.py, README.md, and the MIT license file.

Steps:
1. Create the setup.py file.
2. Create the README.md file.
3. Create the LICENSE file with MIT license.
4. Create the ClassyFlaskDB package directory with __init__.py file.
